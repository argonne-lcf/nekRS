# How to contribute

Thank you for considering contributing to nekRS!
Here are a few important things you should know about contributing:

* Please create a pull request (PR) on GitHub merging into the latest next branch.

* We prefer a PR for one thing at a time. If you have many contributions, please split them in different PRs.

* If you are planning a large contribution, we encourage you to interact with the maintainer (via GitHub or email) to ensure that your effort is well-directed.

* Mimic our coding style/conventions and respect our design. Your contribution should fit well in the existing source code. 

* Update the surrounding e.g. examples, documentation (whatever is affected by your contribution).

* Provide evidence of correctness and performance. 

* Any significant changes should be accompanied by tests. The project already has good test coverage, so look at some existing tests if you're unsure how to go about it. 

* Comment on limitations and known issues. 

* Your PR will be reviewed by subject matter experts and the lead maintainer will make the final decision. 

* Weâ€™ll either merge it, provide feedback for changes, or close it with a short explanation.

* The act of submitting a PR (with or without an explicit Signed-off-by tag) will be understood as an affirmation of
the developer certificate of origin (DCO), which you can find at http://developercertificate.org/. 

* We won't preserve the original commit author information but all contributors are acknowledged in the notes of each release.
