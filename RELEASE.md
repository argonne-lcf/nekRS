# (Draft) Release v24.1

v24.1 is a patch release focused on bug fixes and essential updates for Aurora.
For code developers, please note that major changes are expected in the upcoming v25.

## What is new?

**New features:**

* (Experimental) On-the-fly oct-tree mesh refinement.
  For example, `[GENERAL] refine=2,3` performs two rounds of refinement: `1-> 8 -> 8 x 27`.
  It supports restarts from coarse meshes using the restart option:
  `startFrom = "r1.fld+refine=2;3"`. See *ethier* example with `ciMode=24,25,26,27`.
* Support for multiple restart files. Separate filenames by commas:
  `startFrom = "r1.fld+X,r2.fld+U,r3.fld+S"` (no spaces). This reads mesh, velocity and scalars from `r1.fld`, `r2.fld` and  `r3.fld`, respectively.
* New command-line option `--output <path-to-logfile>` to specify the path to the logfile.
* Support XXT as a `coarseSolver` option (see *ethier* `ciMode=28`).
* Support for Intel GPUs on ALCF/Aurora (see `nrsqsub_aurora`).
* Support Nek5000's explicit filter with `regularization=explicit` (see *ethier* `ciMode=30`).

**Other changes:**

* Add additional timers during setup.
* Incorporate Nek5000â€™s nullspace treatment in GMRES, controlled via `setArgs("PGMRES NULLSPACE ZERO MEAN ALGEBRAIC NORM", "TRUE")`.
* Revert multithread JIT to avoid possibility of hangs on Aurora and Frontier.
* (WIP) Update scripts for Frontier (amd/gnu?), Aurora, Polaris (Perlmutter)
* Add a workaround option avoid restart hangs via crystal router, controlled by
  `setArgs("CHECKPOINT READ USE CRYSTAL ROUTER", "TRUE")`.
* Add `[MESH] maxElements` to specify `lelg` used in `mkSIZE`, enabling more flexible CI test.
* Rename `amgSolver` to `coarseSolver` to support XXT and future options.

## Good to know

These changes deviate from v24 but *might* become defaults in v25:

* Always calling `userchk` during setup, followed by a mesh update.
* Revert default norm to `LEGACY`.
* Switch default solver from combined PCG to standard PCG.

## Various Bugs Fixed

* Fix duplicated CFL check; allow user-defined limit via `setArg("MAXIMIUM CFL","1000")`.
* Fix nekAscent API issues.
* Fix interpolation setup in the *hemi* example.
* Fix IO of Nek checkpoint file header to prevent integer overflow.
* Dump timesteps into Nek checkpoint files
* Properly read restart options for scalars. `startFrom = "r.fld+S"` reads all scalars.
* Eliminate redundant copies during SYM BC alignment detection.
* Find `.co2` based on the name of `.re2`
* Fix infinite loops bug in `occa::memory opSEM::strongDivergence`.

## Known Bugs / Restrictions

TODO: Link to github issues

- `ethier` example fails to run on 2 nodes of Aurora due to unregistered kernels.
  TODO: Verify and update.
- Correctness check in kernel benchmark is temporarily disabled due to the robustness issue.
- (Aurora) Device streamTag timer is still unreliable; `DEVICE:MAX` may report negative durations.
- (Aurora) MPI-related issues observed in parCon, parRSB, FEM setup and checkpoint reading.

## Breaking Changes

This list provides an overview of the most significant changes in this release, although it may not encompass all modifications. We acknowledge that this release introduces several breaking changes. These adjustments were essential to enhance the stability of the user interface in future iterations. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

* run `build.sh` instead of `nrsconfig` to build the code
* change par section `SCALAR00` to `TEMPERATURE` in case it represent indeed a physical temperature
* `nek::userchk` is no longer called automatically during the setup phase
* host mirrored variables including `nrs->U, cds->S, mesh->x, nrs->usrwrk` have been removed
* send signal (defined in env-var `NEKRS_SIGNUM_UPD`) to process trigger file `nekrs.upd`
* use `auto foo = platform->deviceMemoryPool.reserve<T>(nWords)` instead of pre-allocated dfloat slices like `platform->o_mempool.slice0`
* change count argument of `occa::memory::slice, occa::memory::copyFrom, occa::memory::copyTo` to number of words instead of bytes
* use `nekrs_registerPtr` instead of common blocks NRSSCPTR / SCNRS in usr file and access them using `nek::ptr` in udf (see examples)

### Name Changes
* `velocityDirichletConditions` -> `codedFixedValueVelocity` (same for scalars)
* `velocityNeumannConditions` -> `codedFixedGradientVelocity` (same for scalars)

* remove `nrs_t` argument from all UDF functions (nrs object is now globally accessible within udf if the Navier Stokes solver is enabled)
* `nrs_t::userProperties = std::function<void(double)>` -> `udf::properties = std::function<void(nrs_t *, dfloat, occa::memory, occa::memory, occa::memory, occa::memory)>`

* `nrs_t::userDivergence = std::function<void(double)>` -> `udf::udfdif = std::function<void(nrs_t *, dfloat, occa::memory)>`
* `tavg::setup(dlong fieldOffset, const fields& fields)` -> `tavg::setup(nrs_t*)`
* `planarAvg(mesh_t*, const std::string&, int, int, int, int, dlong, occa::memory o_avg)` -> `postProcessing::planarAvg(nrs_t*, const std::string&, int, int, int, int, occa::memory)`
* `::postProcessing` functions are now members of `nrs_t` (except planarAvg)
* remove `nrs_t` argument from `<plugin>::setup`
